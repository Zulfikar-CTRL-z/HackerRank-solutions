## Problem

Julia conducted a $15$ days of learning SQL contest. The start date of the contest was _March 01, 2016_ and the end date was _March 15, 2016_. 

Write a query to print total number of unique hackers who made at least $1$ submission each day (starting on the first day of the contest), and find the _hacker\_id_ and _name_ of the hacker who made maximum number of submissions each day. If more than one such hacker has a maximum number of submissions, print the lowest *hacker\_id*. The query should print this information for each day of the contest, sorted by the date.

**Input Format**

The following tables hold contest data:

- _Hackers:_ The _hacker\_id_ is the id of the hacker, and _name_ is the name of the hacker.<img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/hr-challenge-images/19597/1458511164-12adec3b8b-ScreenShot2016-03-21at3.26.47AM.png"/>

- _Submissions:_ The _submission\_date_ is the date of the submission, _submission\_id_ is the id of the submission, _hacker\_id_ is the id of the hacker who made the submission, and _score_ is the score of the submission. <img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/hr-challenge-images/19597/1458511251-0b534030b9-ScreenShot2016-03-21at3.26.56AM.png"/>

```sql
/*
Enter your query here.
*/
SELECT con.contest_id, con.hacker_id, con.name, SUM(sg.total_submissions), SUM(sg.total_accepted_submissions),
SUM(vg.total_views), SUM(vg.total_unique_views)
FROM Contests AS con 
JOIN Colleges AS col
ON con.contest_id = col.contest_id
JOIN Challenges AS cha 
ON cha.college_id = col.college_id
LEFT JOIN
(SELECT ss.challenge_id, SUM(ss.total_submissions) AS total_submissions, SUM(ss.total_accepted_submissions) AS total_accepted_submissions FROM 
Submission_Stats AS ss GROUP BY ss.challenge_id) AS sg
ON cha.challenge_id = sg.challenge_id
LEFT JOIN
(SELECT vs.challenge_id, SUM(vs.total_views) AS total_views, SUM(total_unique_views) AS total_unique_views FROM View_Stats AS vs GROUP BY vs.challenge_id) AS vg
ON cha.challenge_id = vg.challenge_id
GROUP BY con.contest_id, con.hacker_id, con.name
HAVING SUM(sg.total_submissions)+
       SUM(sg.total_accepted_submissions)+
       SUM(vg.total_views)+
       SUM(vg.total_unique_views) > 0
ORDER BY con.contest_id;

## Problem

Write a program to generate and print the  **Fibonacci series**  up to the  **$N$th term**  using a for-loop.

The  **Fibonacci series**  is the sequence where each number is the  **sum of the previous two numbers of the sequence** 

The number at the  **nth position**  can be represented by:
 **Fn = Fn-1 + Fn-2** 
where,
 **F0 = 0 and F1 = 1** 

Check the sample input / output below for further clarity.
